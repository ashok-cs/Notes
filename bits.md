## Series of bits
A series of bits represent every digital artifact. It may be text, image or video. 

**Byte:** A series of 8 bits is known as byte. A byte can hold 256 unique numbers (0 to 255).

**ASCII:** Characters are represented by a numeric code. For example 95 represents ‘a’. Each ASCII code requires 7 bits. Hence, one byte can hold one ASCII character.

**ASCII text:** A text “WELCOME” is represented with the respective ASCII values  87, 69, 76, 67, 79, 77 and 69, stored in the consecutive bytes.

**Unicode text:** ASCII code has the limitation to represent only 128 characters with 7 bits. It is sufficient to represent alpha, numeric and special characters. But, it couldn’t represent all possible characters from different languages. Hence, a special encoding scheme, called unicode text format (utf) is commonly used to represent text in web documents (HTML).

**Image pixel:** Images are formed with pixels. For example, a JPEG image is represented by 800x600 pixels. For a color image, we use three bytes to represent red, green and blue components of a pixel (RGB format). Black color is represented by (0,0,0). White color has the RGB value(255,255,255). Red color is represented with (255,0,0). Yellow has the value (255,255,0).
